## Introduction

This Laravel Zoom integration allows you to seamlessly incorporate Zoom functionality into your Laravel application. With this integration, you can schedule, manage, and interact with Zoom meetings directly from your Laravel app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- PHP >= 7.3
- Composer installed
- Laravel >= 

## Installation

To install the Laravel Zoom integration, follow these steps:

```bash
composer require your-zoom-package-name
Configuration
After installation, configure the Zoom API credentials in your Laravel app. You can find the configuration file at config/zoom.php. Add your Zoom API key and secret.

php
Copy code
return [
    'api_key' => env('ZOOM_API_KEY'),
    'api_secret' => env('ZOOM_API_SECRET'),
];
Usage
You can now use the Zoom features in your Laravel app. For example:

php
Copy code
use Zoom;

// Schedule a new meeting
Zoom::scheduleMeeting($attributes);

// Get upcoming meetings
$meetings = Zoom::getUpcomingMeetings();
Cron Jobs
To automate specific tasks, set up cron jobs for your Laravel app. Add the following entries to your crontab file:

bash
Copy code
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-laravel-app && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
This will run Laravel's scheduler every minute.
